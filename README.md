# network-automation
This repo is aggregates all of my network automation projects into one place. 

All code is meant to be built and integrated into the various features of this project, such as the 
custom logging function I've built for handling any variety of code exceptions and reporting them
to the logging destination of your choice - Syslog, SNMP, API webhooks, etc.
